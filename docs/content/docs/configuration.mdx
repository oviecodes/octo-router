description: Detailed guide on how to configure Octo Router using yaml.
---

Octo Router is configured via a `config.yaml` file located in the root directory. This section provides an overview of the config.yaml file and it's fields.

## Providers

Define your LLM providers and their API keys. You can use environment variables using the `${VAR}` syntax.

```yaml
providers:
  - name: openai
    apiKey: ${OPENAI_API_KEY}
    enabled: true
  
```

## Models

The config has a model section to define the default models for each providers set up in the provider section

```yaml
models:
  defaults:
    openai:
      model: "openai/gpt-4o-mini"
      maxTokens: 4096

    anthropic:
      model: "anthropic/claude-haiku-3"
      maxTokens: 4096

    gemini:
      model: "gemini/gemini-2.5-flash-lite"
      maxTokens: 4096
```

If these defaults are not provided then a default model is selected by OctoRouter automatically. The default models are needed for certain routing strategies like round-robin and most especially if the semantic routing is disabled.


## Routing Strategies

Choose how requests are distributed when multiple providers are available.

- `weighted`: Distribute traffic based on defined weights.
- `cost-based`: Route to the cheapest model that meets your requirements.
- `latency-based`: Route to the fastest responding provider.
- `round-robin `: Distributes request across multiple providers equally.

```yaml
routing:
  strategy: "weighted"
  weights:
    openai: 70
    anthropic: 30
```

## Semantic Routing

Semantic routing allows you to route requests based on user intent. When in embedding mode, It uses a local ONNX model to classify prompts into "intent groups".

```yaml
routing:
  policies:
    semantic:
      enabled: true
      engine: "embedding"
      threshold: 0.45      
      model_path: "assets/models/embedding.onnx"
      groups:
        - name: "coding"
          required_capability: "code-gen"
          allow_providers: ["openai"]
```

## Limits

Manage costs by setting daily budgets per provider or globally.

```yaml
limits:
  dailyBudget: 50.00
  providers:
    openai:
      budget: 10.00
```

## Resilience

Manage timeouts, retries and circuit breakers

```yaml
resilience:
  timeout: 30000  # 30 second timeout
  
  retries:
    maxAttempts: 3
    initialDelay: 1000  # 1 second
    maxDelay: 10000     # 10 seconds
    backoffMultiplier: 2  # Exponential backoff
  
  circuitBreaker:
    failureThreshold: 5  # Open after 5 failures
    resetTimeout: 60000

```
