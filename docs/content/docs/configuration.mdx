description: Detailed guide on how to configure Octo Router using yaml.
---

Octo Router is configured via a `config.yaml` file located in the root directory.

## Providers

Define your LLM providers and their API keys. You can use environment variables using the `${VAR}` syntax.

```yaml
providers:
  - name: openai
    apiKey: ${OPENAI_API_KEY}
    enabled: true
  
  - name: anthropic
    apiKey: ${ANTHROPIC_API_KEY}
    enabled: true
```

## Routing Strategies

Choose how requests are distributed when multiple providers are available.

- `weighted`: Distribute traffic based on defined weights.
- `cost-based`: Route to the cheapest model that meets your requirements.
- `latency-based`: Route to the fastest responding provider.

```yaml
routing:
  strategy: "weighted"
  weights:
    openai: 70
    anthropic: 30
```

## Semantic Routing

Semantic routing allows you to route requests based on user intent. It uses a local ONNX model to classify prompts into "intent groups".

```yaml
routing:
  policies:
    semantic:
      enabled: true
      engine: "embedding"
      threshold: 0.45      
      model_path: "assets/models/embedding.onnx"
      groups:
        - name: "coding"
          required_capability: "code-gen"
          allow_providers: ["openai"]
```

## Budgeting

Manage costs by setting daily budgets per provider or globally.

```yaml
limits:
  dailyBudget: 50.00
  providers:
    openai:
      budget: 10.00
```
