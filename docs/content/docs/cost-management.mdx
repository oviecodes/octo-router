title: Cost Management
description: Learn how to control costs and manage budgets with Octo Router.
---

One of Octo Router's primary goals is to make LLM usage affordable and predictable. It provides a robust budgeting system that tracks usage across all providers.

## Budget Hierarchy

Budgets can be defined at multiple levels in `config.yaml`:

1. **Global Limits**: Caps the total spending across all users and providers.
2. **Provider Limits**: Caps spending for a specific provider (e.g., OpenAI).
3. **User Limits**: (Future) Caps spending per user.

## Configuration

To enable cost management, you must configure the `limits` and `costManagement` sections.

```yaml
limits:
  # Daily global budget in USD
  dailyBudget: 50.00
  
  # Alert threshold (logs a warning)
  alertThreshold: 40.00
  
  providers:
    openai:
      budget: 10.00  # Stop OpenAI requests after $10
    anthropic:
      budget: 20.00
```

## Auto-Downgrade

The "Auto-Downgrade" feature automatically switches to a cheaper model or provider when you are approaching your budget limits.

```yaml
costManagement:
  autoDowngrade:
    enabled: true
    threshold: 0.9  # At 90% of usage, switch to cheaper models
```

## Tracking Costs

Octo Router returns usage metadata in every response, compatible with the OpenAI format.

```json
{
  "usage": {
    "prompt_tokens": 10,
    "completion_tokens": 20,
    "total_tokens": 30,
    "cost_usd": 0.00045 
  }
}
```

You can also query the [Admin API](/docs/api-reference#admin-api) to get current budget status.
