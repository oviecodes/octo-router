---

There are two primary ways to run Octo Router: locally using the Go toolchain or containerized via Docker.

## Local Installation

### Prerequisites
- **Go**: 1.25.4 or higher
- **Redis**: Required for budgeting and rate limiting.
- **ONNX Runtime**: Required for semantic routing.

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/oviecodes/octo-router.git
cd llm-router
```

### 2. Configure Environment
Copy the example environment file and add your API keys:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
```bash
go mod download
```

### 4. Run the Server
```bash
go run cmd/server/main.go
```

## Docker Deployment (Recommended)

Docker is the easiest way to get started as it bundles all dependencies, including the ONNX runtime library.

### 1. Start with Docker Compose
```bash
docker compose up --build
```
This will start both the Octo Router API and a Redis instance automatically.

## Next Steps

Once the router is running, you can start [configuring your providers](/docs/configuration) or test the API using an OpenAI-compatible client.
