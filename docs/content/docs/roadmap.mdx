description: Future features and planned improvements for Octo Router.
---

Octo Router is rapidly evolving. This roadmap outlines the major features and architectural improvements we are currently working on.

## Model Capabilities

- **Tool Calling (Function Calling)**: Standardizing tool definitions and responses across all supported providers.
- **Vision Support**: Native handling of image inputs for multi-modal models.
- **JSON Mode**: Enforcing structured outputs across the fallback chain.

## Core Engine Improvements

- **High-Performance Caching**:
  - **Exact Match**: Fully activating the Redis-backed response cache for identical prompts.
  - **Semantic Caching**: Implementing vector-similarity lookup to reduce costs for conceptually similar queries.
- **Advanced Cost Controls**:
  - **Global Budgets**: Enforcing total spending caps across the entire cluster.
  - **Auto-Downgrade**: Automatically failing over to cheaper tiers when approaching budget limits.
  - **Operational Alerts**: Real-time notifications via Webhooks/Slack when thresholds are reached.

## Enterprise Features

- **Multi-Tenancy**: 
  - Per-user/Per-key quotas and rate limits.
  - Detailed usage tiering (e.g., Free vs. Pro user routing).
- **Admin Dashboard**: A built-in web interface for:
  - Real-time cost monitoring.
  - Live configuration reloading.
  - Provider health and latency visualization.

## Ecosystem & Integrations

- **Local Providers**: Direct support for local LLM engines:
  - **Ollama**
  - **vLLM**
  - **llama.cpp**
- **SDKs**: Official client libraries for Python, TypeScript, and Go.
