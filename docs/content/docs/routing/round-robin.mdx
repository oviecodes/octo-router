## Round Robin Routing

Round Robin is a **provider-centric** strategy that cycles through your healthy providers in a fixed order. It ensures an even distribution of requests across your infrastructure, assuming all providers are healthy.

### Configuration

To enable round-robin routing, set your strategy to `round-robin`.

```yaml
routing:
  strategy: "round-robin"
```

### How it Works

1. **Circular Queue**: Octo Router maintains an internal pointer to the "next" provider in the list.
2. **Selection**: For each new request, the router picks the next provider in sequence.
3. **Health Awareness**: If a provider's [Circuit Breaker](/docs/resilience) is open, the router automatically skips it and moves to the next one in the queue.

### Interaction with Semantic Policies

Round Robin works with [Semantic Policies](/docs/routing/semantic) by operating on the *filtered* set:

1. **Filtering**: The semantic policy narrows down the providers based on intent (e.g., only "fast-chat" providers).
2. **Sequential Rotation**: The router then performs its round-robin cycle *only* among that subset of allowed providers.

### Summary: Round Robin vs Others

| Feature | Round Robin | Weighted Strategy | Latency-Based |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Primary Unit** | **Provider** | **Provider** | **Provider** |
| **Logic** | Sequential Rotation | Percentage distribution | Fastest Response |
| **Model Choice** | Uses provider's **default** | Uses provider's **default** | Uses provider's **default** |
| **Best For** | Even load balancing | Testing specific ratios | Performance optimization |
