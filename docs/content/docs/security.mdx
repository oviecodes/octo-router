description: Secure your Octo Router instances with API keys and rate limiting.
---

Octo Router provides built-in security features to protect your endpoints from unauthorized access and prevent abuse through distributed rate limiting.

## API Key Authentication

Octo Router supports simple and effective API key authentication using Bearer tokens. When configured, all requests to the router must include a valid key in the `Authorization` header.

### Configuration

Add your authorized keys to the `security` section of your `config.yaml`:

```yaml
security:
  apiKeys:
    - "your-secret-key-1"
    - "your-secret-key-2"
```

> [!TIP]
> We recommend using high-entropy strings for your API keys. You can use environment variables to keep keys out of your configuration files: `apiKeys: ["${ROUTER_API_KEY}"]`.

### Authenticating Requests

To authenticate, include the key in your HTTP headers:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-secret-key-1" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  ...
```

## Rate Limiting

Octo Router implements token-bucket rate limiting to protect your infrastructure and manage upstream provider quotas.

### Global Rate Limits

Limit the total number of requests the router accepts per minute across all providers.

```yaml
limits:
  requestsPerMinute: 100  # Global RPM cap
```

### Provider Rate Limits

Manage individual provider quotas to prevent 429 errors from upstream LLMs.

```yaml
limits:
  providers:
    openai:
      requestsPerMinute: 50
    anthropic:
      requestsPerMinute: 20
```

## Distributed Security

When using **Redis**, rate limit counters are shared across all Octo Router instances. This ensures that your limits are enforced globally, regardless of how many replicas you are running in your cluster.

| Feature | In-Memory | Redis (Recommended) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Auth Performance** | Near-instant | Near-instant |
| **Rate Limit Scope** | Per-instance | Cluster-wide |
| **Persistence** | Lost on restart | Persistent |

## Future Security Roadmap
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Fine-grained permissions for admin vs. member keys.
- **Per-User Quotas**: Limiting usage based on sub-identifiers in the request metadata.
- **IP Allowlisting**: Restricting access to specific CIDR blocks.
